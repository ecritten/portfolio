<h1>Final Project: Part III</h1>

<h2>Final Data Story: Getting Here</h2>

I determined that the audience for my final data story is arts and community organizers; specially, those that are involved in programming and community engagement. The goal is for these people to implement creative placemaking practices in their own communities. I made many additional changes from the user research stage to the final product. I adjusted the first visualization, which had been a treemap showing the U.S. GDP by industry, to better support my argument. Since the arts and culture didn't make up an immediately impressive portion of the GDP in this visualization, I removed the other industries in the data and visualized the measure alone to demonstrate the arts' economic value using simple icons (along with a few other data-points). Another decision I had to make over the last week was how to adjust my conflict section so that it supported the rest of the story. I originally wanted to find and visualize quantitative data regarding the relationship between arts/creative industry initiatives and gentrification here; however, I wasn't able to find any, and I decided that using peripheral data as evidence (job growth in certain areas, etc.) might be confusing or misleading in the greater context of my story. Therefore, I removed the point about arts-related developments being potentially harmful and instead focused on the idea of "missed opportunities" in arts programming. 

Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.
