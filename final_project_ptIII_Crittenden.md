<h1>Final Project: Part III</h1>

<h2>Final Data Story: Getting Here</h2>

I determined that the audience for my final data story is arts and community organizers; in particular, those that are involved in programming and community engagement. This made the solution and call to action more oriented around what organizers should know and can do to begin equitable creative placemaking as the goal is for these people to implement creative placemaking practices in their own communities. I made many additional changes from the user research stage to the final product. I adjusted the first visualization, which had been a tree map showing the U.S. GDP by industry, to better support my argument. Since the arts and culture didn't necessarily make up an impressive portion of the GDP in this visualization, I removed the other industries in the data and visualized the value alone to demonstrate the arts' economic value using a simple icon (alongside a few other data-points to support this point with various measures.) Another decision I had to make over the last week was how to adjust my conflict section so that it supported the rest of the story. I originally wanted to find and visualize quantitative data regarding the relationship between arts/creative industry initiatives and gentrification here; however, I wasn't able to find this data, and I decided that using peripheral data as evidence (housing prices, job growth in certain areas, etc.) might be confusing or misleading in the greater context of my story. Based on feedback I received from user research, I didn’t want this argument to be hollow. Therefore, I removed the point about arts-related developments being potentially harmful and instead focused on the idea of "missed opportunities" in terms of arts programming and community needs. I think this made for a smoother transition from set-up to conflict to solution. I also thought that honing in on "missed opportunities" may be more enticing to the audience, the people who need to recognize and act on such opportunities—it feels a little more specific. 

One of the most important changes I made for the final version of the data story was adding a case study. Multiple people that I interviewed in my user research mentioned that they would have liked to see a successful example from the field. Adding the case study at the end serves to clarify the concepts and inspire the audience to implement the concepts in their own work. It also provides data to inform the network diagram visualization. This was a good lesson in story-telling itself: people appreciate real-world examples that they can associate concepts with. 

Additional, smaller changes I made in this final stage included adding text to fill out the story and improving the design of the site with images, headers, etc. 

One of my greatest challenges with this project was visualizing the qualitative data I had. Each qualitative data visualization saw several iterations in which I tried to find the balance between displaying the data clearly vs. creatively. My initial designs skewed to the more creative side, but, through the design process, representing the information clearly was the way to go—this was a good lesson for me. I ended up creating simple infographics in Infogram for a couple of these and I used Flourish designs for communicating concepts for the others.
