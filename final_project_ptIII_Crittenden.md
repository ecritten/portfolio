Final project overview
The final project will be your opportunity to put everything you've learned so far into action.  A core goal of the final project will be understanding your audience and ensuring you are communicating at an appropriate level, and telling the story using data visualization methods that are meaningful.  

Part III: The final deliverable
In Part I you developed a pitch for your final presentation that included copies to your working datasets.  You also identified how you intended to tell your story, identifying the method and medium you planned on using. 

In Part II started to construct the actual narrative that will take the reader on the journey through your story complemented with your sketches, wireframes, storyboards and moodboards.   You also completed user research on your idea, and looked for ways to improve your story. 

By the end of Part III, your final deliverable should be complete and publicly accessible as a digital asset (e.g. you've published your story on Shorthand, etc.).  You will also have a writeup on Github that summarizes your work done in the final week as outlined below.  Finally, you should have also completed your presentation during class. 

For this week, your final deliverables for Part III of your final project will include the following:

1. A final writeup for Part III on a new Github page that summarizes all the work you've done thus far to create your final project.  

2. A final data story / report on Shorthand (or similar platform you proposed in Part I). 

3. A Word document that includes the text for your final report submitted through TurnItIn. 

4. A presentation given on your final data story / report during class. 

Your final project pages for Part I, II and III be linked together and should include links / references to everything you've used. 

NOTE: You don't need to re-write or recreate content you've already created for parts I and II of this assignment as long as it's already organized in an easy-to-follow way.  The writeup on Github should serve as a kind of "behind the scenes" look at how you created your work.  When reviewing Part III of your final assignment, I should be able to clearly follow along in your progress - noting how you used everything you've created in Part I and Part II to develop your final project. 

Part I: The idea (you already did this)

The project outline (Part I)
'A high-level summary of your project.  (Part I)
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story. (Part I)
A short paragraph that documents your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. (Part I)
A link to the publicly-accessible data you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. (Part I)
A few paragraphs summarizing your approach to the project (method and medium - Part I)
Part II: Design and user research (you already did this)

Wireframes and storyboards (Part II)
User research protocol and findings (Part II)
Part III: Final data story (due as part of this assignment)

A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)
Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)
Add a link to your final data story (a direct link to Shorthand / StoryMap / etc.) placed in the final presentation spreadsheet.  Add the link next to your name in the spreadsheet, and update the title to reflect the working title for your presentation.  (Part III)
Include all references for materials used.  It's your responsibility to ensure you have permission to use imagery and other assets, and that you use them appropriately.  A reminder to NOT USE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - see the library's guide to ensure you are using images correctly.  Make sure to add / update any citations and / or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.  References should also be clearly identified on your final data story itself.  Review the library's guide if you have questions. (Part III)
Include any other information that helps round out your data story. (Part III)
What to turn in
Once you are finished with your project and feel you're ready to submit your work, copy and paste the text from your story (e.g. from Shorthand, ArcGIS Story Maps) into a new Word document.  Submit your Word document along with the link to your final project. In order to ensure the originality of your work, make sure to adjust your final writeup if the automated system identifies any issues.  

The final presentation
Final projects will be done in person, in class according to the presentation schedule.  You will also participate in a critique for your fellow classmates using the critique form provided.   Final project presentations are worth 10% of your grade.
