Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data, Mini 3, Spring 2021

# About me
My full first name is Elizabeth, but everybody calls me B. I use she/her pronouns. I am currently a second-year student in the Master of Arts Management program at Heinz College. My background is in the performing arts, but I have worked in a variety of arts organizations, from music, to dance, to museums. Once I graduate, I plan to work for a performing arts organization in general management/operations, artistic planning, or community engagement.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to build a robust but practical toolkit of dataviz resources to carry forward into my career for any data visualization needs that might come up! I also hope to learn best practices of dataviz and become more comfortable and confident with turning complex ideas and data into simple and effective visualizations.
