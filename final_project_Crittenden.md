<h1> Final Project: Part I </h1>

<h2>Outline</h2>

In this project, I'm interesting in showing how the arts and culture sectors have a well-established economic impact, but there is potential for them to better address needs and make a greater impact in their communities. I will make an example of how creative placemaking in food and agriculture initiatives achieves this idea of equitable community development. 

The arts and culture should adopt creative placemaking practices and work collaboratively to foster inclusive community development and better address the needs of their communities. The audience of this project is artists, arts and culture organizers, community organizers, and public administrators. After reading it, they should want to incorporate creative placemaking into their programming/planning/activities to improve the community's sense of identity, pride, self-reliance, health, and leadership of community residents. They can do this by collaborating with artists, community residents, and organizers, leveraging existing assets and using these to address the community's needs. 

<h3>Project Structure:</h3>

<h2>Initial sketches</h2>

Set up: The arts/culture are a powerful catalyst for economic development <br>
Conflict: Art/culture in isolation isn't as impactful as it could be and can have a negative effect on its local communities (e.g. development leads to gentrication and displacement)<br>
Resolution: The arts/culture can serve its communities more fully and inclusively by incorporating creative placemaking practices, working in collaboration and leveraging community assets to address unique needs of the community (e.g. Equitable Food Oriented Development and Creative Placemaking; farmers markets as hubs for cultural exchange)

<h2>The data</h2>

This project will require information from several different data sets and types. Three primary sets of raw data will be used: Americans for the Arts' (AFTA) Arts Vitality Index data will we used in the "Set up" to show how the arts impact their local economies; I plan to pull out data for the state of Pennsylvania to visualize as a map using bubbles to depict volume of economic impact. The Food Environment Atlas data will be used in the "Conflict" portion of the project to visualize food deserts in Pennsylvania as I set up the example of Equitable Food Oriented Development and Creative Placemaking. The ArtPlace Sector Analysis is a set of qualitative data and will be used to create a concept map that communicates the ways that collaborations between arts/culture and food/agriculture initiatives impact their communities. 

The remaining data is pulled from the following reports on creative placemaking and farmers markets (which will be used to exemplify how farmers markets incorporate creative placemaking and improve their communities.)

<h2>Method and medium</h2>

The final project will be presented using Shorthand. I plan to use a simple design and focus on a color scheme with greens, grays, and whites. I will incorporate photographs of communities gathering at markets (available for public use, of course.) 

The visualizations will be created using Tableau. I may use Flourish and Canva, as well. Tableau will be used to create the maps (food desert map and Arts Vitality Index map) and to generate the bar charts visualizing the quantative data (reported benefits of farmers markets and creative economy data). 

I may end up using Flourish to generate the Network Diagram (to demonstrate asset-based community development) and may use Canva to create the conceptual visualizations.
