A couple paragraphs describing what your process was. You should include a few insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering a redesign, if anything.  You should talk about how you moved next to the wireframes, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  If it led you to change anything about your data visualization's design, mention what that was.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently.

You can also include screenshots of your wireframes or other artifacts with your narrative if it helps tell the story of how you moved through the process.

Feedback on Infogram wireframe: 

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Visitor dissatisfaction with customer service â€¦ for an arts and culture org. That it has increased & why.
the chart shows the increase of reported dissatisfactory customer service interactions, comparing jan 20 to jan 21. notes that the rise takes into account pandemic conditions


- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Lack of reasoning for 2020.
I think it's surprising that the main complaint is that exhibits are closed given that it's debatable whether or not museums/arts facilities should be open at all. (maybe this is not the answer you are looking for) I intuit the lowest complaint being crowding issues is a sign that these facilities have put covid measures/distancing in place


- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Internal PR/management
perhaps the administrators of the arts facilities who respond to customer service complaints, or could be used in an academic journal reporting on the arts


- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Add reasoning for 2020.

I guess im a little confused about the gray bars' values and what they mean but also I am not a numbers guy. so if I was more well versed in charts probably I would get it
