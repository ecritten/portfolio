A couple paragraphs describing what your process was. You should include a few insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering a redesign, if anything.  You should talk about how you moved next to the wireframes, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  If it led you to change anything about your data visualization's design, mention what that was.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently.

You can also include screenshots of your wireframes or other artifacts with your narrative if it helps tell the story of how you moved through the process.
