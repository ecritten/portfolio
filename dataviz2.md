Third Data Visualization: 

This chart depicts the debt-to-GDP ratio of each country included in the data set between 1995-2019, much like the grid of line charts above; however, is it visualized in a single chart and allows the user to toggle between country using the buttons floating above the chart or view all countries at once by selecting "All". An opaque-gray horizontal bar highlights the range of the US's ratio during this time-period so that it can be used to benchmark against the others. 

The color scheme of this visualization is simple: navy blue for the ratio values over a white background, light gray grid lines (horizontal and verticle), and the opaque-gray bar to show the US's range of values. I intended to distinguish between the US's line and all other countries' lines using color (by using contrasting colors and having the US's stand out more) in the "All" view, but unfortunately couldn't figure out how to single out the US's line in this chart tupe.

This chart's audience is anybody who would like to compare other countries' debt-to-GDP ratios with the US's. It will be particarly useful for someone who is interested in interacting with the visualization by toggling from one country to another and using the interactive pop-ups on the data-points.

Clear title and brief description for your visualization once embedded on your page.  


Finally, use Markdown to write a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.
