Third Data Visualization: Debt-to-GDP Ratios, Various Countries vs. USA Range (1995-2019)

This chart depicts the debt-to-GDP ratio of each country included in the data set between 1995-2019, much like the grid of line charts above; however, is it visualized in a single chart and allows the user to toggle between countries using the buttons floating above the chart or view all countries at once by selecting "All". An opaque-gray horizontal bar highlights the range of the US's ratio values between 1995 and 2019 so that it can be used to benchmark against the others. 

The color scheme of this visualization is simple: navy blue for the ratio values over a white background, light-gray grid lines (horizontal and vertical), and the opaque-gray bar to show the US's range of values. I intended to distinguish between the US's line and all other countries' lines using color (by using contrasting colors and having the US's stand out more) in the "All" view, but unfortunately couldn't figure out how to single out the US's line in this chart type.

This chart's audience is anybody who would like to compare other countries' debt-to-GDP ratios with the US's range of ratios. It will be particarly useful for someone who is interested in interacting with the visualization by toggling from one country to another (or looking to compare it with one or two countries in particular) and using the interactive pop-ups on the data-points.

The first visualization (bar chart) is useful for isolating a single year and comparing ratio values across countries, and ordering it by ratio values makes it easier find meaning quickly. The second visualization (grid of line charts) is useful for identifying any outliers or unusual-looking sets of values per country across time. However, it is difficult to look at all of these at once and easily compare country to country; it is most useful for identifying lines that appear to be particularly abnormal in terms of shape. 

This is why I approached the third visualization the way I did: I wanted to view the ratio values across time (like the second visualization), but I wanted to be able compare the data easier and I wanted a single chart in view (as opposed to the grid of charts, which I found to laborious to comprehend). Supposing that the audience wants to see how the US ratios compare to each country's, I highlighted the US's range in each view. Toggling between each country allows the user to access detailed ratios in the date-range and compare these value's to the US's range. The "All" buttom gives a less-detailed but more general overview of the data.
