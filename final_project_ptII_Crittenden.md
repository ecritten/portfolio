<h1>Final Project: Part II</h1>

<h2>Wireframes and storyboards</h2>
Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards.  

Your wireframes should include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Your wireframes should integrate your data visualizations through some kind of storyboard-like format.  Your storyboards should be a visual walk-through of the primary elements of your outline, tying in your sketches where appropriate to illustrate how you intend to lead the reader through your experience. You may use whatever method makes the most sense to you (hand-drawn, digital, etc.). Some students find it useful to build out a draft of their story in Shorthand, and use that for user research.  If you wish to do that, that's fine too. 

<h2>User research and interviews</h2>
You should have also developed a simple user research protocol that describes what you hope to find during your user interviews, including your research questions and the script.  Once your interviews are complete, you should have documented findings that detail what you've learned by showing your early wireframes / storyboards to at least three different individuals.  

Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 

<h2>Optional: moodboards and personas</h2>
You may find it helpful to use a moodboard to both identify examples of what has worked well when visualizing similar datasets, as well as any general themes in color, typography, or other elements.  Use your moodboards to help construct your story further.   Personas can also be used to help you create a representation of the kind of readers you expect to address with your final project.  Both these artifacts will help you in Part III should you choose to create them.
