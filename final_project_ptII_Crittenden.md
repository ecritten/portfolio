<h2>User Research and Interviews</h2>

<h3>Target Audience:</h3>

Arts/culture/creative industry administrators, artists, and community organizers in the U.S. â€“ people who plan arts/cultural/community events and could implement creative placemaking practices going forward. 

<h3>Approach to Interviewees:</h3>

I want my sample to include an artist and then a couple of arts administrators. I want a balance of arts admins who both do and don't have much prior knowledge of community engagement and creative placemaking. 

My sample...
- 1 mid-career artist
- 1 arts/culture/creative industry administrator without a community engagement background
- 1 arts/culture/creative industry with a community engagement background
